00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,500
Previously, in Camille's adventures:

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,000
Every day Camille uses some application

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
on her smartphone,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,200
but she discovered the existence of trackers,

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,800
those little pieces of code

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,000
which collect informations about her.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,500
Camille asks her self

11
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,000
how those trackers came into the applications?

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
An Exodus Privacy video

13
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,000
In order to answer this question,

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,900
Camille must understand

15
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,000
how applications are made.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
An application is a little bit like a car.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
They are both complex to build.

22
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,800
A lot of work

23
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,000
Developers,

30
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,600
the persons who write code in computer language

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,800
could choose to use an already done piece of code

32
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,000
from code libraries

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,800
or write all the application code from scratch.

34
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,000
Ok. So when did the trackers come into the applications?

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,700
A tracker is a piece of code.

36
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,000
So someone has written it at one time

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
into the application program.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,800
It could come form the persons who wrote the applications,

39
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,700
for example if their income comes from advertising.

40
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:57,300
But sometimes this people do not even know they add tracker.

41
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,800
For example, if a developer uses a piece of code written by others

42
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,800
which uses geolocation whitout her knowledge,

43
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,900
and the final application will have a tracker.

44
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,300
And if Camille installs it on her smartphone,

45
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,900
she will be tracked through this.

46
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,140
As we can find the same engine in differents cars,

47
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,900
we can find same trackers in many applications.

48
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,800
To keep an eye on Camille's adventure,

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,150
